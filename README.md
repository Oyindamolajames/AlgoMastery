# Algo Mastery Track

Welcome to the Algo Mastery Track! This repository is dedicated to tracking my journey through data structures and algorithms. Each solution is carefully documented with the problem link, my approach, and the final solution code.

## Google Sheet Structure

- **Problems**: Each problem is documented with:
  - Problem Name and Link
  - Difficulty Level
  - Date Solved
  - Approach Summary
  - Key Learnings
  - Revisit Notes

- **Solutions**: All solutions are stored in the `solutions` folder, organized by problem name.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Navigate** to the `solutions` folder to find the code for each problem.
2. **Read the Approach** section to understand how I tackled the problem.
3. **Explore the Code** to see the solution implementation in Python.
